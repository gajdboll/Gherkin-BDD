# V1 - Background / Scenario Outlines 



Background - that s the keyword we are using for situation which is repeated,
So when certain scenario/step is repeated - we can gather it under background section to remove repetition


Scenario Outlines - that s the keyword which is used for example table (all the additional conditions)


Example: keyword always used with "Scenario Outlines" it contains table with all the possible scenarios 
It might contains different test - because the data might be different from each other.
The headers from the examples in the *.feature file need to match arguments pasted in the steps - they are hightlighted in the "<>" like <login> etc.

In the Login.feature additional scenario is created and additional steps and examples.

Check Login Features & LoginSteps for reference 


always make sure that all the keywords are ended with ":"  , otherwise they will not be picked up by IDE's
